            <p><b>Technical Skills</b></p>
            <p>I have experience with Python, C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Assembly. My experience with Python, HTML, CSS, and C/C++ is more extensive than my experience with Java, Javascript, and Assembly. I also have experience and am familiar with working in PyCharm, VS Code, Eclipse, and, most recently, Google Cloud. I have worked with HTML, CSS, Python, C++, PyCharm, and VS Code for a year or more, while my other skills are more recent.</p>

            <p><b>Areas of Interest</b></p>
            <p>My interest lie mostly within data science as it pertains to data analysis and organization. I believe that data is the foundation of the modern world. The way in which we go about our lives every day, from online shopping to checking the weather, is determined by the way in which we organize, store, and analyze data. I consider organizing data not only essential but also fun to do, and the process of analyzing said data to recognize patterns, or the lack thereof, and draw conclusions is very rewarding to me.</p>
            <p>I am also deeply interested in the development of assistive technology that can help improve the quality of life of marginalized individuals, such as those with disabilities.  I am driven by the belief that computer science can play a crucial role in addressing social and cultural issues, and with my computer science degree, I hope to gain the technical expertise to create technology that can enhance the daily experience of those with disabilities, making their lives easier and more accessible. The work of foundations like <a href="https://ablegamers.org/" target="_blank" class="custom-link">AbleGamers</a> inspires me and fuels my devotion to give back to people through the skills I have learned and will learn studying Computer Science.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, beyond utilizing computing principles to help those with disabilities, those same principles can be used in finding ways to assist those who are less fortunate and have access to less opportunities than others. Those in marginalized communities, such as people of color or others in underrepresented communities, often have access to limited resources and opportunities to achieve their full potential, but I recognize the power of technology to break down barriers and create more opportunities and avenues for success for these underrepresented groups. The constant evolution of the computing field has led me to believe in the endless potential of using modern technology and algorithms to better the lives of people which are often ignored by society at large.</p>
