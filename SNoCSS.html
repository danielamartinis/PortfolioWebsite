    <p><b>Spanish Tutoring</b></p>
    <img src="tutoring.jpg" alt="tutoring">
    <p>I partake in tutoring Spanish to people at any skill level (beginner to intermediate). As a native Spanish speaker, I am in a privileged position where I can help others in their language learning journey. Being able to teach Spanish as both the proper language and in a conversational manner is very important to me and I am glad to be able to contribute that knowledge to my community.</p>
